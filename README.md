# R2INT
My cellular automata simulator project!

This repository contains the code for R2INT, a cellular automata simulator program made to simulate rules from the Range-2 Isotropic Non-Totalistic (R2INT) rulespace.  As this program is in early development, its features are quite limited.  It currently only simulates a range-2 outer-totalistic rule that I made, and it has no functionality to edit paterns or rules yet.
