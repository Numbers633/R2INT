# R2INT
My cellular automata simulator project!

This repository contains the code for R2INT, a cellular automata simulator program made to simulate rules from the Range-2 Isotropic Non-Totalistic (R2INT) rulespace.  By default, it simulates Conway's Game of Life (B3/S23), with the option to create custom rules.  Some notable features include:
* Rule Editor: This rule editor uses an intuitive design to easily modify rules without needing a large, arbitrary table.  BSome features, including undo and randomize, still need to be added.
* Saving to R2INT rule files and printing the RLE of the current pattern to the command prompt have recently been added.  Loading RLE patterns have not been added yet.

This program is still in early development; expect lots of major changes!  Currently, only basic pattern editing is supported.
